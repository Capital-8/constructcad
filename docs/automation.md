# Automation: engine, command line and MCP

[Português](automacao.md)

Everything ConstructCraft does to a model can be done without the interface. The **engine** (`cc_engine`) holds the operations as a catalog of named **commands**; three clients use that one catalog:

```
                 ┌──────────────────────────────┐
  desktop app ──▶│                              │
  ccad (CLI)  ──▶│  cc_engine: Session +        │──▶ the model (.ccad)
  MCP agents  ──▶│  catalog of commands         │
  Lua scripts ──▶│  (+ plugin commands)         │
                 └──────────────────────────────┘
```

A wall drawn with the mouse, a `ccad run wall_create …`, a Lua script calling `ccad.run("wall_create", …)` and an AI agent calling the `wall_create` tool run the same code, with the same defaults, checks and undo. The full list of commands with their parameters is in the [command reference](commands.md); [plugins](#plugins) add their own commands to the catalog.

## Concepts

**Session.** One open project: the document (with its undo history) plus geometry and drawings derived from it. The CLI opens one per invocation (or script), the MCP server one per connection, the app one per window.

**Commands.** Each command has a `snake_case` name, a JSON object of parameters described by a JSON Schema, and a JSON result. Kinds:

| Kind | Does | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| query | reads the model | `elements_list`, `element_get`, `schedule_table` |
| edit | changes the model: one undo step | `wall_create`, `elements_move`, `element_set` |
| file | works with files or replaces the project | `project_open`, `ifc_import`, `sheet_export` |

**Units and coordinates.** Lengths are meters, angles degrees, points `[x, y]` in plan. Dimensions use the coordinates of their view's drawing (plan X/Y in plans; horizontal position and height in elevations and sections). Areas and volumes in results are m² and m³.

**References.** Levels, types, views and materials are given by **id or name** (`"level": 3` or `"level": "Ground"`; names are matched without regard to case; an ambiguous name is an error asking for the id). Sheets can also be named by their number (`"A101"`). Elements are given by id; `elements_list` and the results of creating commands give them. Omitted levels default to the lowest level and omitted types to the category's default type.

**Reading and changing parameters.** `element_get`, `type_get` and `view_get` show an object's `params`; `element_set`, `type_set` and `view_set` take the fields to change in the same shape and merge them in:

```sh
ccad -p house.ccad run element_get id=42
ccad -p house.ccad --save run element_set id=42 'params={"height": 2.7}'
ccad -p house.ccad --save run element_set id=57 'params={"shape": {"Gable": {"slope": 0.5, "ridge_deg": 0}}}'
```

Objects merge field by field; arrays and plain values replace; `null` clears an optional value. `material_set`, `units_set` (shaped like `material_get`, `units_get`) work alike.

**View graphics.** What a view shows and how is part of the view: `view_graphics_get` lists every category's visibility and overrides, the applied filters and the element overrides; `view_graphics_set` shows or hides a category and overrides its projection and cut lines (color, weight in paper mm, pattern), surface and cut fills (color, pattern), halftone and transparency; `element_override_set` and `element_hide_in_view` do the same for single elements in one view. Overrides are objects like `{"cut_lines": {"color": [255, 0, 0], "weight": 0.5, "pattern": "Dash"}, "cut_fill": {"pattern": "Solid", "color": [200, 200, 200]}, "halftone": true, "transparency": 0.4}`; they merge like `params` (`null` resets an attribute, `reset: true` starts over). They apply to plans, ceiling plans, elevations, sections, 3D views, sheets and PDF/SVG exports.

```sh
ccad -p house.ccad --save run view_graphics_set view=Térreo category=door visible=false
ccad -p house.ccad --save run filter_create name=Long 'categories=["wall"]' 'rules=[{"param": "length", "op": "greater", "value": 5}]'
ccad -p house.ccad --save run view_filter_add view=Térreo filter=Long 'overrides={"cut_lines": {"color": [255, 0, 0]}}'
ccad -p house.ccad run filter_elements filter=Long
```

*Filters* (`filter_create`, `filter_set`, `filter_delete`, `filters_list`, `filter_elements`) select elements by category and rules on parameters — any schedule field (`type`, `mark`, `comments`, `level`, `material`, `system`, `structural`, `width`, `height`, `thickness`, `length`, `area`, `volume`, `diameter`…) or `elevation` (of the element's level) — with `equals`, `not_equals`, `contains`, `not_contains`, `begins_with`, `not_begins_with`, `greater`, `greater_or_equal`, `less`, `less_or_equal`, `has_value` and `has_no_value`, all of them (default) or any (`any: true`). A rule on a field that none of the filter's categories has (`width` on walls) is refused, since it could never pass. Quantities are compared in SI units (meters), text without case. A view applies filters in order (`view_filter_add`, `view_filter_set`, `view_filter_move`, `view_filter_remove`): the first matching filter wins for each attribute, an element's own overrides beat the filters, and filters beat the category; an element is hidden when it is hidden in the view, its category is off, or any matching filter hides it.

*View templates* (`template_create` from a view, `template_set`, `template_delete`, `templates_list`) hold a scale, category graphics, filters, the plan cut height, the building services display (services over a faint architecture) and the structural display, each with an `include` flag. `view_template_apply` copies them into views once; `view_template_assign` makes views follow a template: the included properties are copied now and on every change of the template (in the same undo step), and editing them in the view is refused. Deleting a template frees its views, which keep their properties.

*Temporary hide/isolate* (`view_temporary` with `action` `hide`, `isolate`, `hide_category`, `isolate_category` or `reset`) is display state of the session, not a model change: it is not saved, not undone and not printed (sheets and exports show the view whole). `view_temporary_apply` makes it permanent (hidden in the view, categories turned off) as one undo step.

**Construction phases.** A renovation is modeled in phases (`phases_list`; the template has *Existing* and *New Construction*): every model element is built in a phase (`phase_created`) and may be demolished in the same or a later one (`phase_demolished`), as `element_get` shows. `phase_create` (at the end or `before` another), `phase_set` (rename, or move with `index`; a move that would demolish elements before building them is refused) and `phase_delete` (a phase in use needs `merge_into`) manage them. New elements are built in the session's creation phase (`phase_creation_set`; the active view's in the app, else the last phase), copies too. `elements_phase_set` sets `created` and `demolished` (`null`: standing) and `elements_demolish` demolishes in a `phase` or the phase of a `view`. Doors, windows and rebar follow their hosts: they are never older than their host and are demolished with it unless demolished earlier. Dimensions, text and grids have no phase.

```sh
ccad -p house.ccad --save run elements_phase_set 'ids=[12, 13]' created=Existing
ccad -p house.ccad --save run elements_demolish 'ids=[13]' view=Térreo
ccad -p house.ccad --save run view_set view=Térreo 'phase_filter=Show Previous + Demo'
ccad -p house.ccad run phases_list
```

Each plan, elevation, section, 3D view and schedule shows the model in its `phase` with a `phase_filter` (`view_set`; view templates control the filter, not the phase). Relative to the view's phase an element is *existing* (built earlier, standing), *demolished* (in this phase), *new* (built in this phase) or *temporary* (built and demolished in it); elements built later or demolished earlier are not shown. Phase filters (`phase_filters_list`, `phase_filter_create`, `phase_filter_set`, `phase_filter_delete`; the template has *Show All*, *Show Complete*, *Show New*, *Show Previous + Demo*, *Show Previous + New*, *Show Previous Phase* and *Show Demo + New*) map each status to `not_displayed`, `by_category` or `overridden`, which uses the project's graphics of the status (`phase_graphics_get`, `phase_graphics_set`: existing faint, demolished dashed without cut pattern, temporary faint and dashed), below element overrides and view filters and above the category. A view whose phase leaves elements out gets geometry of its own: doors of later phases do not open existing walls and walls join only with walls of the phase. A room is bounded by the walls standing at the end of the phase it is created in, so walls demolished in that phase or earlier do not bound it. Schedules list what their phase and filter show and offer the fields `PhaseCreated` and `PhaseDemolished` (also usable in filter rules as `phase_created`, `phase_demolished`).

**Project browser organization.** The project browser groups the views by type alone unless a scheme is in use. `browser_scheme_create` makes a named scheme (`group_by`: the criteria from the outermost group in, among `view_type`, `level`, `discipline` and `phase`; default `["view_type", "level"]`) and puts it in use unless `use_it` is false; `browser_scheme_set` renames it or changes its criteria, `browser_scheme_delete` removes it, and `browser_scheme_use` picks the scheme the browser follows (no `scheme`: the default). `browser_schemes_list` lists them, and `browser_tree` returns the tree the browser shows — group rows with `group`, `name`, `value`, `views` and `children`, view rows with `view` and `name` — for the scheme in use, another `scheme`, or any `group_by`. A view without a value for a criterion (a section has no level) stays beside that criterion's groups.

**Design options.** Alternatives for part of the model live in option sets (`options_list`): `option_set_create` makes a set with named `options` (the first is primary), `option_create`, `option_set` (rename, `primary: true`, move with `index`), `option_delete` (not the primary; it deletes the option's elements), `option_set_rename` and `option_set_delete` (with every element of its options) manage them. An element belongs to the main model or to one option (`element_get` `design_option`); `elements_option_set` moves elements into an option or back with `null` (doors, windows and other hosted elements follow their host; annotations have no option). Each plan, elevation, section, 3D view and schedule shows the main model plus one option per set: `view_options_set` chooses one, or `null` for automatic (`view_get` `design_options` shows the choice and what is shown); view templates can control it (`template_set` `design_options`, `include.design_options`). Automatic means the option being edited when it is in that set (`option_active_set`, session state, not saved: new model elements go into it), else the primary. Elements of options a view does not show are left out of its drawing, schedule and geometry: walls join and rooms are bounded only among what is shown together. `option_accept_primary` moves the primary option's elements into the main model and deletes the set with its other options and their elements. IFC export writes the main model and the primary options only, each option element with `ConstructCAD_DesignOption` (`OptionSet`, `Option`, `Primary`), which import reads back as sets and options.

```sh
ccad -p house.ccad --save run option_set_create name=Entrance 'options=["Porch", "Canopy"]'
ccad -p house.ccad --save run elements_option_set 'ids=[31]' option="Entrance: Canopy"
ccad -p house.ccad --save run view_options_set view=Térreo set=Entrance option=Canopy
```

**Scales.** A view's `scale` is the denominator `N` of 1:`N`. `view_create`, `view_set`, `template_set` and `callout_create` also take it as text: `"1:50"`, or in imperial projects a label such as `"1/4\" = 1'-0\""` (48) or `"1\" = 20'"` (240). `view_get` adds `scale_text`, the scale as the project writes it (`1:50`, or `1/4" = 1'-0"` in imperial projects), and an imperial callout's default detail scale is an imperial one.

**Measurement systems.** Command parameters and results are SI whatever the project's units (meters, square and cubic meters, degrees, kilograms; slopes in percent where a command says so), and so are files, IFC and DXF; `project_info` reports the `system`. What a command writes as text follows the project: in an imperial project the types it makes on demand are named and sized in round inches (`Ramp 4'-0"`, `Baseboard 4"`, `Cable tray 8"×4"`, `Conductor Ø3/8"`, door types `2'-8" x 6'-8"`, profiles `I 8"x8"x1/4"x3/8"`; defaults such as wall and story heights, pipe and device elevations, drain falls, rebar cover and terrain contours are imperial too, as each parameter's description says), check messages (`stair_check`, `ramp_check`) write inches and slopes per 12, and schedules (`schedule_table`, `schedule_export_csv`) write `lb` and `lb/ft` for weights, inches for thicknesses, diameters and risers, and headers without metric units. Conductor cross-sections stay in mm².

**Drafting views.** `view_create` with `kind: "drafting"` makes a 2D view independent of the model (category `drafting`, 1:10 unless `scale` says otherwise): it draws no model geometry, only the elements placed in it — `text_create`, `dimension_create` (and the chain and ordinate forms), `cad_import` and `image_import` take it as their `view`. `view_get` shows its `scale` and `detail`, `view_set` changes them (it has no phase or visual style), and `view_graphics_set` hides or overrides its categories. It goes on sheets with `sheet_place_view` and exports with `view_export` (PNG, SVG, PDF, DXF) like other views; `view_delete` deletes what was drawn in it.

**Callouts and detail views.** `callout_create` draws a callout in a floor plan, ceiling plan, section or elevation (`parent`): `rect` is two opposite corners in the parent's drawing coordinates (meters; `y` is the height in sections and elevations). It makes a detail view of that region (named `Detail N` unless `name` says otherwise, at `scale`, by default a standard scale about five times larger than the parent's: 1:10 under 1:50) of the parent's kind, so it stays live with the model: it follows the parent's level, section line or direction, shows the model as the parent does (phase, detail level, visual style, graphics) and is cropped to the rectangle, and its own detail lines, regions, detail components, texts and dimensions are drawn whole. With `drafting`, the callout points to that existing drafting view instead (no crop; one callout per drafting view). The parent draws the callout as a rectangle with rounded corners and a tag: the detail's number on its sheet over the sheet's number once it is placed, else the last word of its name over a dash. `view_get` shows `crop` (`[[min x, min y], [max x, max y]]`) and `callout` (`parent`, `parent_name`, `rect`, `drafting`); `view_set` `crop` moves or resizes a detail view's callout (they are one rectangle), crops any plan, section or elevation, or with `null` shows everything again (a callout needs its rectangle); for a drafting view a callout points to, it moves that callout. `callouts_list` lists the callouts drawn in a view, `callout_remove` removes a callout and keeps its view, `view_delete` of a detail view removes its callout, and deleting the parent leaves its details as ordinary cropped views. Plans do not draw a section's or elevation's detail view as another section or elevation mark. Files whose callouts point to missing views, or whose crops are not valid rectangles, are repaired on load.

```sh
ccad -p house.ccad --save run callout_create parent="Ground Floor" rect=[[2,3],[5,6]] scale=20
```

**Detail lines.** `detail_line_create` draws view-specific 2D lines in a floor plan, ceiling plan, elevation, section, legend or drafting view (`view`), in the view's drawing coordinates in meters (as for text notes and dimensions): `curves` take the same forms as sketches (`line`, `arc` by `bulge` or `through`, `circle`, `ellipse` or part of one, `rectangle`, `polygon`), each curve one element (category `detailline`; a polyline is its segments), all in one undo step, and `style` is one of the built-in line styles `thin` (default), `medium`, `wide`, `hidden`, `dashed`, `center` and `dotted`. Only their view draws them, on top of the model; `view_delete` deletes them with it, and 3D views and IFC export leave them out. `element_get` shows `params.curve` (the curve as `Line`, `Arc`, `Circle` or `Ellipse`) and `params.style` (`{"BuiltIn": "Wide"}`) with the derived `length` and `style_name`; `element_set` changes them (`"style": "hidden"` also works). The generic commands edit them: `elements_move`, `elements_copy`, `elements_rotate`, `elements_mirror`, `elements_delete`, `trim_corner` (two detail lines, meeting where their lines, circles or ellipses cross), `trim_extend` (to another detail line or the line of a wall, beam or grid), `element_split` and `element_offset` (arcs and circles concentric; ellipses have no offset). DXF export puts them on a layer named after their style (`THIN`, `CENTER`…).

```sh
ccad -p house.ccad --save run detail_line_create view=Térreo style=dashed 'curves=[{"kind":"circle","center":[2,3],"radius":0.5}]'
```

**Line styles.** Besides the built-in styles, a project has its own line styles (name, weight on paper in mm, color, dash pattern), kept as project settings: `line_styles_list` lists both (built-in by code, the project's by name, with `weight`, `color`, `pattern` and `used_by`), `line_style_create` adds one (`name` unique and not a built-in code, `weight` 0.05 to 5 mm, default 0.25, `color` `[r, g, b]`, `pattern` `solid`, `dash`, `short_dash`, `dot` or `dash_dot`), `line_style_set` changes it (the lines drawn with it follow) and `line_style_delete` deletes it, moving the detail lines and region boundaries that use it to `replace_with` (default `thin`) in the same undo step. Wherever a command takes a line style (`detail_line_create`'s `style`, a region's `boundary`, `element_set`) a project style is named like a built-in one; `params.style` then reads `{"Project": <id>}`. A file whose lines use a style that is gone gets the thin style when it is opened.

**Filled and masking regions.** `filled_region_create` draws a 2D area in a floor plan, ceiling plan, elevation, section, legend or drafting view (`view`), in its drawing coordinates in meters: `curves` (as for sketches) close into loops, the largest the outline and those inside it openings, all in one undo step. It is filled as its type says and edged in the `boundary` line style (default `thin`; `none` for no boundary); `type` picks a filled region type, else the project's first, made with the first region (diagonal lines over white). `filled_region_type_create` makes another (`foreground` and `background` patterns — `none`, `solid`, `diagonal`, `diagonal_back`, `crosshatch`, `horizontal`, `vertical`, `grid`, `brick`, `concrete`, `sand`, `insulation`, `earth` — each with its color; a `solid` pattern fills with its color and a `none` background leaves the model visible between the pattern lines); `type_set` changes its `fill`. `masking_region_create` draws an opaque white area that hides the model's linework under it (no boundary unless `boundary` names a style). Regions are drawn in their own view only, in id order, over the model and under the view's annotations (detail lines, dimensions, texts and, in plans, tags, grids and section marks); 3D views and IFC export leave them out. `element_get` shows `params` (`outline`, `openings`, `sketch`, `boundary`) with the derived `area`, `perimeter` and `boundary_name`; `element_set` changes the type or `"boundary": "wide"` / `"none"`; `sketch_get` and `sketch_set` read and redraw the outline; the move, copy, rotate, mirror and delete commands work on them, and `view_delete` deletes them with their view. Exports write the fills: SVG, PDF and PNG as polygons (a region with openings as one ring), DXF as `SOLID` triangles and pattern lines on a layer named after the boundary's style (a region without a boundary on its category's, `FILLEDREGION` or `MASKINGREGION`).

```sh
ccad -p house.ccad --save run filled_region_create view=Térreo boundary=wide 'curves=[{"kind":"rectangle","corner":[0,0],"opposite":[4,3]}]'
```

**Detail components.** A detail component is a reusable 2D component for construction details (category `detailcomponent`, component kind `Detail`): its pieces are the 2D pieces title blocks use — `stroke` (lines and arcs through points, open or `closed`, with a pen `weight` in paper millimeters, `color`, dash `pattern` and, closed, a solid `fill` or a pattern fill), `text` and `image` — plus `nested` pieces that place another detail component inside it (`component`, `x`, `y`, `rotation`, `scale`, `mirrored`), all in meters in its own frame (text heights too) and as numbers or expressions over its parameters. `detail_component_create` makes one as a new type named `name` (unique among types and components): from `pieces`, or from `elements` of a `view` — detail lines keep their pen, filled and masking regions become closed strokes with their fill (openings as outlines), text notes texts at their printed height (leaders as lines) and detail components nested pieces — whose point `origin` (default: the lower left corner of their extents) becomes the component's origin; with `replace` (default true) those elements are deleted and the component is placed where they were (`placed`), all in one undo step. `detail_component_place` places a type in a floor plan, ceiling plan, elevation, section, legend or drafting view (`view`): its origin at `position`, turned `rotation` degrees, sized by `scale` (0.0001 to 10000) and flipped across its own X axis first when `mirrored`. Only that view draws it, over the model and its regions and under detail lines and annotations; `view_delete` deletes it with the view, and 3D views and IFC leave it out. `element_get` shows `params` (`view`, `position`, `rotation_deg`, `scale`, `mirrored`, `overrides`) with the derived `component`, `pieces` and `nested`; `element_set` changes them (not the view); the move, copy, rotate, mirror and delete commands work on it. `component_sheet_piece_add`, `component_sheet_piece_set` and `component_sheet_piece_delete` edit a detail component's pieces (every placed one follows), `component_param_*` its parameters. A nested piece names a component (it reads the parameter values of that component's first type); naming one that holds this component (a cycle) is refused, and drawing stops at 8 levels of nesting and a budget of pieces in any case. `component_save` writes the components it nests into the `.ccomp` file too, and `component_load` adds those the project lacks; `component_library_list` lists detail components with `kind` `Detail` and `category` `detail_component`. `cad_import` with `blocks: true` brings a DWG or DXF file's blocks in as detail components instead of flattening them: every block inserted by a move, turn, uniform scale or mirror becomes a type named after it (its own inserts of blocks as nested pieces, references that would close a cycle dropped), each such insert of the drawing a placed detail component, and what is left (other inserts, dimensions, loose entities) stays in the imported drawing; the result lists the new `components.types` and `components.elements`. DXF export (`view_export`) writes a view's detail components as blocks (one per component, a placed one with its own parameter values its own) and `INSERT`s on the `DETAILCOMPONENT` layer, the nested ones as inserts inside their blocks.

```sh
ccad -p house.ccad --save run detail_component_create name=Brick 'pieces=[{"kind":"stroke","closed":true,"fill":[200,80,60],"points":[{"u":0,"v":0},{"u":0.2,"v":0},{"u":0.2,"v":0.1},{"u":0,"v":0.1}]}]'
ccad -p house.ccad --save run detail_component_place type=Brick view="Drafting View 1" position=[1,2] rotation=90
ccad -p house.ccad --save run cad_import path=details.dwg view="Drafting View 1" blocks=true
```

**Imported CAD drawings.** `cad_import` reads a DWG (R12 to 2018 and later, through the acadrust library) or DXF file (ASCII or binary, read by ConstructCraft itself) into a floor plan, ceiling plan, elevation, section, legend or drafting view as one undo step, and reports what it read: `format`, `version`, `units` (and `units_assumed`), `layers`, `entities`, `blocks`, `primitives`, `skipped` (entities not drawn, by type), `truncated` and the `extents` in the view. Blocks are inserted (nested, scaled, rotated, arrayed), arcs and circles stay arcs, ellipses, splines and hatch boundaries become polylines, texts and MTEXT keep their position, height and rotation; 3D solids, images, infinite lines and similar entities are skipped. `position` with `align` places the drawing's origin (`origin`, default), the center of its extents (`center`) or the origin unless it is more than 1 km from the view's content (`auto`); `units` overrides the file's (`mm`, `cm`, `dm`, `m`, `km`, `in`, `ft`, `yd`, `mi`), and unitless files are read as meters when small, else millimeters. The element starts pinned and only its view draws it, under the model (category `cadimport`; 3D views and IFC export leave it out). `element_get` shows its placement in `params` (`units`, `scale`, `position`, `rotation_deg`, `mirrored`, `hidden_layers`, `color_mode` `Grey`/`Layers`/`Black`, `halftone`) but not the drawing; `element_set` changes them; the move, rotate, mirror, pin and delete commands work on it. `cad_layers` lists its layers and `cad_layers_set` shows or hides them. `cad_explode` turns it into native elements of its view in one undo step: lines, polylines (bulged segments as arcs), arcs and circles become detail lines, one element per segment (ellipses, splines and hatch boundaries, stored as polylines, come out as their segments); fills become filled regions with no boundary, of a solid filled region type of the fill's color (named *Solid #RRGGBB*, reused when one fills with that color); single-line texts become text notes at the same place, height, rotation and alignment, of a text type of their size on paper at the view's scale (reused when one has that size). Each layer becomes a project line style of the layer's name and color (light colors darkened for paper), reused when a style of that name exists; layers hidden in the element are left out (it starts with those off or frozen in the file), and the placement is applied. Pictures stay in the element (its other primitives removed); without them the element is deleted. The color mode and halftone are not carried over. The result lists the `created` elements, the counts `detail_lines`, `filled_regions` and `texts`, the new `line_styles` and `types`, `kept` (the element when pictures stay) and `skipped` primitives (too small or out of bounds); a drawing that would make more than 100,000 elements, or add more than 1,000 types, is refused. With `cad_import` `blocks: true` the blocks are already detail components, so exploding leaves them as they are.

```sh
ccad -p house.ccad --save run cad_import path=survey.dwg view=Térreo align=auto
ccad -p house.ccad --save run element_set id=120 'params={"units": "Centimeters", "halftone": true}'
ccad -p house.ccad --save run cad_layers_set id=120 'layers=["DIM", "TEXT"]' visible=false
ccad -p house.ccad --save run cad_explode id=120
```

**Validation and undo.** Every edit is one undo step (`undo`, `redo`). An edit that would leave the model invalid — a door pointing at a missing wall, a negative size, a reference to nothing — is refused and leaves no trace. Pinned elements are not moved, trimmed or deleted.

**Errors.** A failed command returns `{"error": {"code": …, "message": …}}`. Messages are in the session's language (`--lang`, `language_set`).

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `unknown_command` | no command has that name |
| `invalid_arguments` | the parameters do not match the schema or make no sense (zero length, unknown kind…) |
| `not_found` | a referenced element, type, level, view or material does not exist |
| `rejected` | the edit would leave the model invalid, or is not allowed (pinned, in use…) |
| `io` | reading or writing a file failed |
| `internal` | a bug; the project is kept as it was |
| `script` | a Lua script or plugin failed: a syntax or run-time error, or a limit reached |

## Command line: `ccad`

`ccad` is a separate program without graphics dependencies (it runs on servers and in CI). Release packages include it; from the sources: `cargo build --release -p cc_cli` (the binary is `target/release/ccad`).

Arguments of `run` can be a JSON object, `@file.json`, `-` (standard input) or `key=value` pairs, whose values are read as JSON when they parse and as text otherwise:

```sh
ccad -p house.ccad --save run wall_create start=[0,0] end=[5,0] height=2.8
ccad -p house.ccad --save run wall_create start=[5,0] end=[5,4] mid=[6,2]   # an arc wall through mid
ccad -p house.ccad run elements_list category=door
ccad -p house.ccad --save run view_set '{"view": "Section 1", "scale": 100}'
ccad -p model.ifc --save-as model.ccad run project_info              # import an IFC file
ccad -p house.ccad run sheet_export sheet=A101 path=a101.pdf
ccad -p house.ccad run view_export view="Section 1" path=section.png dpi=300   # any view as PNG, SVG or PDF
ccad -p house.ccad run view_export view="Level 1" path=level1.dxf              # or as DXF, at full size in mm
```

Results are printed as JSON on standard output. Errors go to standard error as JSON with exit code 1; usage errors exit with 2. Without `--save` or `--save-as` the project file is not changed.

Results combine with other tools; for example, with `jq`:

```sh
wall=$(ccad -p house.ccad --save run wall_create start=[0,0] end=[6,0] | jq .id)
ccad -p house.ccad --save run door_create wall=$wall offset=1.5
```

### Scripts

A script is a list of steps, either a JSON array of `{"command": …, "args": {…}}` objects or one such object per line (lines starting with `//` are comments). `ccad script` runs the steps in order in one session and stops at the first error; each step is one undo step.

[`examples/small_house.ccmacro`](../examples/small_house.ccmacro) builds a small house:

```text
// A small house built with engine commands only.
{"command": "wall_create", "args": {"start": [0, 0], "end": [8, 0], "height": 2.8}}
…
{"command": "door_create", "args": {"point": [2, -0.5]}}
{"command": "floor_create", "args": {"from_walls": true}}
{"command": "room_create", "args": {"point": [2, 3], "name": "Living room"}}
```

```sh
ccad --save-as house.ccad script examples/small_house.ccmacro
```

### Outlines drawn with curves

Floors, ceilings, roofs, foundation slabs and masses take their outline as `curves` instead of points: lines, arcs (by `bulge` or a point they pass `through`), circles, ellipses (whole or a part), rectangles and regular polygons (these two become lines). Loops inside the outline are openings of floors and roofs. The element keeps its curves: `sketch_get` gives them back (or lines along the outline of an element drawn with points) and `sketch_set` draws the outline again; moving, rotating and mirroring the element moves them too, and editing the outline's points directly drops them.

```text
{"command": "mass_create", "args": {"curves": [{"kind": "circle", "center": [0, 0], "radius": 5}], "height": 9}}
{"command": "floor_create", "args": {"curves": [{"kind": "rectangle", "corner": [0, 0], "opposite": [10, 8]}, {"kind": "circle", "center": [5, 4], "radius": 1}]}}
```

### Terrain

`topography_create` makes a terrain surface from measured points `[x, y, z]` (elevations above the level) inside a `boundary` or `curves`; with neither, the convex hull of the points bounds it. The boundary's vertices take the elevations the points give them, and the earth closes down to a flat base `base_depth` (default 2 m) below the lowest point, so sections cut it as a solid. `element_get` shows its lowest and highest elevations, base, area, volume and any warnings (`few-points`, `collinear`, `boundary-crossing`) in `derived.topography`. `topography_points_set` replaces the points or changes, removes and adds them by index; `sketch_set` redraws the boundary, and with `points` replaces the points in the same step. A terrain type sets the earth material and the contour lines' interval and majors (`topography_type_create`, `type_set`).

```text
{"command": "topography_create", "args": {"points": [[0, 0, 0], [20, 0, 2], [20, 10, 2.5], [0, 10, 0.5], [10, 5, 1.2]]}}
```

`pad_create` grades a building pad into a terrain: a flat area at `elevation` (meters above the terrain's level) inside an `outline` or `curves`, with a cut slope where the ground stands above it and a fill slope where it lies below, each running out to the existing ground. Slopes are the horizontal run per unit of rise (`cut_slope` 1 is 1:1, `fill_slope` 1.5 is 1:1.5); without them the pad uses its type's (`pad_type_create`, `type_set`). The `host` terrain defaults to the one whose boundary holds the outline's center. A pad lives on its terrain's level, moves with it and is deleted with it; pads of one terrain apply in creation order. `element_get` shows a pad's `cut`, `fill`, `net` (fill − cut), `area` and warnings (`off-terrain`, `coarse`, `failed`) in `derived.pad`, and a terrain's `derived.topography` sums its pads' `cut` and `fill`. Pad schedules have `Elevation`, `CutVolume` and `FillVolume`, which total like volumes.

```text
{"command": "pad_create", "args": {"outline": [[6, 3], [14, 3], [14, 8], [6, 8]], "elevation": 1.2}}
```

### Curtain walls

A curtain wall is a wall whose type has a curtain grid instead of layers: vertical lines along the wall and horizontal lines up from its base (a fixed distance, a number of divisions or a maximum spacing, justified at the start, the center or the end), a panel in each cell (glass, solid, empty or a component, such as a door) and mullions on the lines and around the border. `curtain_type_create` makes the type and `wall_create` places walls of it, straight or arc (flat panels along the arc). Each wall can adjust its grid: `curtain_grid_set` adds, moves and removes its lines and removes pieces of them (the cells beside merge into one panel), `curtain_panel_set` swaps panels, and `curtain_get` lists lines and panels. A curtain wall drawn inside another wall opens it where it stands. Wall schedules have `PanelCount`, `GlazedArea` and `MullionLength`. IFC export writes them as `IfcCurtainWall`s made of `IfcPlate`s and `IfcMember`s and import brings them back with their grid; a curtain wall from another program comes back as one when its panels make a plain grid, else as separate objects.

```text
{"command": "curtain_type_create", "args": {"name": "Storefront", "curtain": {"vertical": {"spacing": 1.2}, "horizontal": {"layout": "FixedNumber", "count": 2}}}}
{"command": "wall_create", "args": {"start": [2, 0], "end": [6, 0], "type": "Storefront", "height": 2.8}}
```

### Cable trays and valves

`cable_tray_create` draws a cable tray run like `conduit_create` (with `circuits`, `offset`, `end_offset`); a project without a cable tray type gets one (200 × 100 mm, ladder), and `cable_tray_type_create` makes others (`width`, `height`, `style`: `ladder`, `solid_bottom` or `perforated`). Trays join only other trays, and their elbows and tees are listed by `mep_fittings`. `valve_place` puts a valve on a pipe at a `point` near it or a `distance` along it, of a `type` or a `kind` (`gate`, `ball`, `check`, `globe`; a type of that kind is made when there is none); `valve_type_create` makes types of several `kinds` at once. A valve takes its pipe's diameter and system, is a node of its network and follows the pipe; `element_get` shows its `derived.point`, `kind` and `diameter`, and `element_set` moves it along the pipe (`params.at`).

```text
{"command": "cable_tray_create", "args": {"start": [0, 0], "end": [6, 0], "circuits": ["1"]}}
{"command": "valve_place", "args": {"pipe": 42, "distance": 0.5, "kind": "ball"}}
```

### Lightning protection and structured cabling

`lps_conductor_create` draws a lightning protection conductor from `start` to `end` (on the roof surface under its ends unless `offset`/`end_offset` say otherwise), or a down conductor from the roof over `start` down to 0.5 m below the level when there is no `end`; `role` (`air`, `down`, `earth`) defaults by where it runs. `earth_ring_create` lays buried conductors around the level's walls (or `points`), `air_terminal_place` puts a rod of `height` on the roof under `position`, and `earth_electrode_place` drives a rod of `length` below the level. They join the first lightning protection system (`system_create` with `kind: "lightning"`), made with the first of them. `lps_check` (`class` `I` to `IV`) samples the roofs and returns how many points the air termination protects, by the rolling sphere and mesh methods, with the unprotected points; `systems_list` gives each lightning protection system's terminals, electrodes and conductor lengths by role.

`rack_place` places a rack and creates its data system (`kind: "data"`, its `panel` the rack, coded after the rack's mark); `data_outlet_place` places outlets cabled to a `rack` (or a data `system`) with `ports` jacks; `cabling_list` gives per rack the outlets, cables, the estimated length of each and the cables over 90 m. `device_type_create` gives the project a built-in device type (`data_outlet`, `rack`, `air_terminal`, `earth_electrode` or any electrical device). Conduits and cable trays carry data systems like circuits.

```text
{"command": "earth_ring_create", "args": {}}
{"command": "lps_conductor_create", "args": {"start": [0, 4], "end": [10, 4]}}
{"command": "air_terminal_place", "args": {"position": [5, 4], "height": 2}}
{"command": "lps_check", "args": {"class": "II"}}
{"command": "rack_place", "args": {"position": [0, 0]}}
{"command": "data_outlet_place", "args": {"position": [8, 3], "rack": 120, "ports": 2}}
```

### Structural profiles

Column and beam types are drawn and built with a structural profile: a standard parametric shape (`i`, `channel`, `rect_tube`, `cold_lipped_u`, `rect`…) of a material (`steel`, `cold_formed`, `timber`, `concrete`), or a sketch. `profile_catalog` lists the built-in series (W, HP, IPE, HEA, HEB, NBR 6355 cold-formed, sawn timber, glulam, SHS, RHS, CHS) and, with `series` (and `search`), their rows; `profile_import` copies rows into the project as profiles that remember their catalog entry (`on_clash`: `keep` the existing profile, the default, or `rename`). `profile_type_create` makes a column or beam type of a profile, with a material of its class; `type_set` changes a type's `profile` (a name, or `null` for its own section), `profile_rotation_deg` and `profile_mirror`. `profile_create`, `profile_set`, `profile_duplicate` and `profile_delete` (`replace_with`) edit profiles, whose types follow; `profile_get` gives the outline and section properties, `element_get` a column's or beam's `derived.section` (area, mass per meter, moments of inertia and moduli), and `analytical_model` each member's section.

```text
{"command": "profile_import", "args": {"series": "IPE", "designations": ["IPE 200"]}}
{"command": "profile_type_create", "args": {"profile": "IPE 200", "category": "beam"}}
{"command": "beam_create", "args": {"type": "IPE 200", "start": [0, 0], "end": [6, 0]}}
{"command": "profile_set", "args": {"profile": "IPE 200", "name": "IPE 200 (roof)"}}
{"command": "profile_get", "args": {"profile": "IPE 200 (roof)"}}
{"command": "profiles_list", "args": {"material": "steel"}}
```

### Structure by material and grid frames

`structural_type_for` (`category` column or beam, `material` concrete, steel or timber) returns the first type of that material, or creates a default one from the catalog. `grid_frame_create` places columns on every storey of a range of levels and beams on the upper levels over the grids (`grids` default all, `base_level`/`top_level` default the lowest two levels, `column_type`/`beam_type` or a `material`), with optional secondary beams in each bay, in one undo step (at most 2000 members); it returns the ids and the number skipped.

```text
{"command": "grid_frame_create", "args": {"base_level": "Térreo", "top_level": "Cobertura", "material": "steel", "secondary": {"parallel_to": 12, "spacing": 2.5}}}
```

`steel_building_create` makes a parametric steel building: portal frames of columns and rafters over `bays` bays, with purlins and girts (`null` turns one off), as ordinary columns and beams in one undo step; types default to the catalog's `W310x38,7`. Its members are regenerated, with their ids kept, when `element_set` changes the building's parameters; a member edited or deleted directly is detached and left alone. Members follow the building's phases and design option, and a copy or paste makes its own. `element_get` lists `derived.members`, `detached` and `at_limit` (the layout reached the member limit and left the last purlins or girts out).

```text
{"command": "steel_building_create", "args": {"span": 24, "eave_height": 7, "bays": 8, "roof": "mono", "girts": null}}
{"command": "element_set", "args": {"id": 42, "params": {"span": 30}}}
```

`truss_create` makes a parametric truss: a host element whose chords, diagonals and posts are ordinary beams and columns, made in one undo step and returned as `{id, members}`. `shape` is `flat`, `mono` or `gable`; `pattern` is `pratt`, `howe`, `warren`, or for gables `kingpost`, `queenpost` and `fink`; `copies` trusses stand `spacing` apart to the left of the span line; `material` (`steel` or `timber`) picks the catalog rows of the default types (concrete is refused). Like a steel building, its members are regenerated with their ids kept when `element_set` changes its parameters, and a member edited or deleted directly is detached.

```text
{"command": "truss_create", "args": {"start": [0, 0], "end": [12, 0], "height": 2, "shape": "gable", "pattern": "fink", "panels": 6, "copies": 5, "spacing": 1.2, "material": "timber"}}
{"command": "element_set", "args": {"id": 42, "params": {"panels": 8}}}
```

`connections_create` places steel and timber connections: `kind` is `base_plate` (on columns), `end_plate`, `fin_plate`, `timber_bolts` or `hanger` (on beams); `members` lists them, else `level` (default the active level) takes all of its columns or beams. Only the ends that suit the kind get one, ends that already have one are skipped, and the result is `{created, skipped}` in one undo step. `params` changes the kind's default sizes (meters; `thickness`, `width` and `length`, 0 meaning from the section, `bolt_diameter`, `rows`, `columns`, `spacing`, `edge`, `anchor_length`). Later `element_set` edits the sizes, not the member, end or kind. Schedules have the fields `ConnectionKind`, `PlateMass` (kg), `BoltCount` and `BoltDiameter`.

```text
{"command": "connections_create", "args": {"kind": "end_plate", "members": [12, 13], "params": {"rows": 3, "bolt_diameter": 0.02}}}
{"command": "element_set", "args": {"id": 42, "params": {"params": {"thickness": 0.02}}}}
```

`wall_framing_create` frames straight walls in light steel or wood: one framing element per wall, owning ordinary columns (studs, king and jack studs, cripples) and beams (tracks or plates, headers, sills, blocking), made in one undo step and returned as `{framings: [{id, wall, members}]}`. `system` is `light_steel` (default) or `wood`; `spacing` is the stud spacing in meters (0.2 to 1.2; 0.4 and 0.6 by default); `stud_type`, `track_type` and `header_type` take an id or a name (default: the system's catalog types); `double_top` (wood) and `blocking` are booleans. Curved walls and walls already framed are refused before anything is made. The members are regenerated, with their ids kept, when `element_set` changes the framing's parameters or when the wall or its doors and windows change; a member edited or deleted directly is detached. The default tracks and plates are the catalog rows turned 90 degrees, lying flat (the section's width is their height); a given type is used as it draws. The framing and its members follow the wall's phases, design option and level. Studs are not merged where an opening reaches a wall end, where two openings are closer than about four stud widths, or at the corner of two framed walls; splitting a framed wall reframes only the part that keeps the framing.

```text
{"command": "wall_framing_create", "args": {"walls": [12, 13], "system": "wood", "blocking": true}}
{"command": "element_set", "args": {"id": 42, "params": {"spacing": 0.4}}}
```

`bracing_create` braces one bay of a frame: a host element whose braces are ordinary beams, made in one undo step and returned as `{id, members}`. The bay is `start` to `end` (the two column axes) or the two `columns`, whose base and height it then takes; `pattern` is `x`, `diagonal` (with `flip` and `alternate`), `v`, `chevron` or `k`; `stories` storeys of `height` stand one above the other from `base_offset`; `material` (`steel` or `timber`) picks the catalog row of the default brace type. `element_set` changes its parameters and regenerates the braces with their ids kept.

```text
{"command": "bracing_create", "args": {"start": [0, 0], "end": [6, 0], "pattern": "chevron", "height": 3, "stories": 4}}
{"command": "bracing_create", "args": {"columns": [12, 13], "pattern": "k", "stories": 2}}
{"command": "element_set", "args": {"id": 42, "params": {"pattern": "X"}}}
```

### Sheets and title blocks

`sheet_set` changes a sheet: `number`, `size` (`"A0"`…`"A4"`, `"ANSI A"`…`"ANSI E"`, `"ARCH A"`…`"ARCH E1"`, `"ARCH E"`, or `{"width": …, "height": …}` in millimeters), `portrait`, `title_block` (a title block type, or `null` for none), `fields` (the sheet's values of the title block's per-sheet fields; `null` clears one) and `issue_date` (`YYYY-MM-DD`, or `""`). `sheet_fields` shows what a sheet's title block will read: every field with its value, the per-sheet fields with this sheet's value and the default, and the pieces that do not resolve. `project_info_set` takes `fields` (project fields by name, read as `{project:Name}`).

A title block is a component whose 2D pieces draw the whole sheet, in millimeters from the paper's bottom-left corner. `title_block_create` copies the standard one (or starts `empty`); `component_sheet_piece_add`, `component_sheet_piece_set` (a merge patch over the piece as `component_get` shows it under `def.sheet`) and `component_sheet_piece_delete` edit its strokes, texts and pictures; several pieces are added (`pieces`), deleted (`indices`) or patched and added (`add`) in one step. A picture is not patched: `component_sheet_piece_set` replaces it with `image_path` (a file) or `image` (base64), and `component_get` and `type_get` show it only as a summary (`format`, `width`, `height`, `bytes`), never as base64. `title_block_create` refuses a name already used by a type or a component. The category is `titleblock` (`types_list`, `categories_list`). `type_delete` may delete the last title block type: its sheets then have no title block, and a sheet without one is drawn as blank paper. Expressions read the parameters and `SheetWidth`/`SheetHeight`, so one title block serves every paper; texts hold `{fields}` (`sheet_number`, `sheet_name`, `sheet_count`, `sheet_index`, `sheet_scale`, `paper`, `project_name`, `project_number`, `client`, `address`, `author`, `date`, `issue_date`, `project:<Name>`, `param:<Name>`). A per-sheet field is a text parameter with `instance`.

```text
{"command": "title_block_create", "args": {"name": "Office"}}
{"command": "component_param_add", "args": {"type": "Office", "name": "Drawn", "kind": "text", "instance": true, "text": "Team"}}
{"command": "component_sheet_piece_add", "args": {"type": "Office", "piece": {"kind": "text", "x": "SheetWidth - 60", "y": 8, "text": "{param:Drawn} · {sheet_index}/{sheet_count}", "size": 2.5}}}
{"command": "component_sheet_piece_add", "args": {"type": "Office", "piece": {"kind": "image", "x": 15, "y": 15, "width": 30, "height": 12, "image_path": "logo.png"}}}
{"command": "view_create", "args": {"kind": "sheet", "name": "Plans"}}
{"command": "sheet_set", "args": {"sheet": "Plans", "title_block": "Office", "size": "A1", "issue_date": "2026-11-06", "fields": {"Drawn": "Ana"}}}
{"command": "sheet_fields", "args": {"sheet": "Plans"}}
```

**References between steps.** Scripts have no variables, but an argument can take a value from the result of an earlier step: `{"$step": n}` is the `id` that step `n` (counted from 1) returned, and `{"$step": n, "path": "/created/0"}` any value of its result, named by a [JSON pointer](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6901). `{"$level": "active"}` is the active level: in the app, the level of the active plan; with `ccad script`, the level given as `level=<id|name>`; without either, the lowest level. A reference to a step that has not run yet, or to a value its result does not have, stops the script with an `invalid_arguments` error.

```text
{"command": "wall_create", "args": {"level": {"$level": "active"}, "start": [0, 0], "end": [6, 0]}}
{"command": "window_create", "args": {"wall": {"$step": 1}, "offset": 2, "sill": 1}}
```

```sh
ccad -p house.ccad --save script walls.ccmacro level="Level 1"
```

Commands also help by accepting positions where it matters (`door_create` and `window_create` find the wall nearest `point`; floors, ceilings and roofs follow the walls with `from_walls`). For logic between steps, write a [Lua script](#lua-scripts), call `ccad run` from a shell script or use an agent over MCP.

## Lua scripts

`ccad lua <file>` runs a [Lua 5.4](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/) script over the session. The script calls commands with `ccad.run`, keeps their results in variables and loops, so an id created by one step can be used by the next. Its arguments (the same forms as `run`: `key=value` pairs, a JSON object, `@file.json`) are `ccad.args`; what it prints goes to standard output and what it returns is printed as JSON.

[`examples/small_house.lua`](../examples/small_house.lua) builds the small house above, sized by its arguments:

```lua
local w = ccad.args.width or 8
local d = ccad.args.depth or 6
local corners = { { 0, 0 }, { w, 0 }, { w, d }, { 0, d } }
local outer = {}
for i = 1, 4 do
  outer[i] = ccad.run("wall_create", { start = corners[i], ["end"] = corners[i % 4 + 1], height = 2.8 }).id
end
ccad.run("door_create", { wall = outer[1], offset = w / 4 })
…
```

```sh
ccad --save-as house.ccad lua examples/small_house.lua width=10 depth=7
```

The `ccad` table:

| | |
|---|---|
| `ccad.run(name, args)` | runs a command and returns its result as a Lua table; raises an error if it fails |
| `ccad.try(name, args)` | the same, but returns `nil, err` on failure (`err.code`, `err.message`; see [Errors](#concepts)) |
| `ccad.commands()` | the commands: `name`, `kind`, `group`, `description` each |
| `ccad.describe(name)` | one command, with the JSON Schema of its parameters as `schema` |
| `ccad.args` | the script's arguments (also `...`) |
| `ccad.null` | JSON `null` (Lua's `nil` leaves a field out) |
| `ccad.array(t)` | marks `t` as a list, so that an empty table is sent as `[]` rather than `{}` |
| `ccad.json.encode(v)`, `ccad.json.decode(s)` | JSON text to and from Lua values |
| `ccad.version`, `ccad.api` | the ConstructCraft version and the plugin API version (1) |

Arguments and results are JSON: objects are tables with string keys, arrays are sequences (`{ 0, 0 }` is a point), `end` is a Lua keyword and is written `["end"]`. A whole number computed with `/` (which always gives a float in Lua) is sent as an integer, so `10 / 2` works where an id or count is expected.

**The sandbox.** Scripts run in a restricted Lua: the `table`, `string`, `math`, `utf8` and `coroutine` libraries and the base functions, without `io`, `os`, `debug`, `package`, `require`, `load`, `dofile` or `loadfile`. A script reaches the project only through commands, and files only through the commands that read or write them. A run has a budget of 500 million Lua instructions, 60 seconds and 256 MB of memory (string functions count by the size of their text, pattern matching by its steps, and `string.rep` and `string.gsub` make at most 16 MB); past them it stops with a `script` error (catching that error with `pcall` does not keep the script going). Each command a script runs is its own undo step.

## Visual programming graphs

A graph (`.ccgraph`, JSON) is a set of nodes joined by wires and run as a
dataflow. **Every engine command is a node**: its parameters are the
node's inputs and its result the `result` output (plus `element`, the id,
for `*_create` commands). Built-in nodes give input values (`number`,
`integer`, `slider`, `boolean`, `text`, `select_elements`,
`elements_of_category`, `levels`), math, logic, lists, geometry as the values
commands take (points `[x, y]`, `line`, `arc`, `circle`, `rectangle`,
`rectangle_points`, `polygon_points`, `polyline_segments`, `divide_line`…),
element parameters (`parameter_get`, `parameter_set`) and outputs (`watch`,
`output`). A Lua node runs a function of its inputs in the sandbox (no
access to the model); it returns its outputs in order, or one table with
their names. `graph_nodes` lists every node with its ports and types.

- **Lists map over nodes.** A node given a list where it takes one value runs
  once per item and its outputs become lists (`lacing`: `shortest`,
  `longest` or `cross`). A list of 4 start points and 4 end points into
  `wall_create` makes 4 walls.
- **Running again updates.** Each element a node creates is bound to the
  node and the item that made it. The next run changes it in place (same id,
  persistent id, mark and comments), makes the new ones and deletes the ones
  no longer made; with nothing changed, nothing happens. A run is one undo
  step. `graph_elements` lists a graph's elements, `graph_release` frees
  them (the next run makes new ones).
- **Order.** A node runs after the nodes wired into it; nodes that do not
  depend on each other run in the order they were added (lowest id first).
- **Errors are per node.** A failing node shows its message, the nodes after
  it are skipped, the others run, and its elements stay as they were.
- A graph never runs `project_new`, `project_open`, `undo`, `redo`,
  `language_set` or graphs, and runs file commands only when whoever runs it allows them: `graph_run`'s
  `allow_files`, `ccad --allow-files graph`, or the editor's *Allow file
  commands* checkbox, which lasts until another graph is opened. A graph
  file cannot allow them itself (an `allow_files` field in it is ignored),
  and a graph a plugin runs never may.

```sh
ccad --save-as house.ccad graph examples/graphs/house.ccgraph width=12 depth=8
ccad run graph_check path=examples/graphs/house.ccgraph
ccad run graph_nodes search=wall
```

Input nodes with a `name` are the graph's inputs (`key=value` above,
`inputs` of `graph_run`); `output` nodes with a `name` are its results. A
minimal graph:

```json
{
  "uid": "6f1c2a0e9b3d4c8a8e2f5a7b1c3d9e02",
  "nodes": [
    { "id": 1, "kind": { "builtin": "range" }, "values": { "end": 15, "step": 5 } },
    { "id": 2, "kind": { "builtin": "point" } },
    { "id": 3, "kind": { "builtin": "point" }, "values": { "y": 4 } },
    { "id": 4, "kind": { "command": "wall_create" }, "values": { "height": 2.8 } }
  ],
  "wires": [
    { "from": [1, "list"], "to": [2, "x"] },
    { "from": [1, "list"], "to": [3, "x"] },
    { "from": [2, "point"], "to": [4, "start"] },
    { "from": [3, "point"], "to": [4, "end"] }
  ]
}
```

## Plugins

A plugin is a folder with a `plugin.toml` manifest and Lua code that adds commands to the catalog. Its commands are listed and run like the built-in ones, by `ccad run`, scripts, Lua scripts and MCP agents, and are named `<plugin id>__<command>` (two underscores, which built-in names never contain).

```sh
ccad --plugins examples/plugins commands                # the catalog, with the plugins' commands
ccad --plugins examples/plugins plugins                 # the plugins, their permissions and commands
ccad --plugins examples/plugins run quick_rooms__rectangle_room width=4 depth=3 name=Office door=south
claude mcp add constructcad -- ccad mcp --plugins /path/to/plugins
```

`--plugins` takes a plugin's folder or a folder of plugin folders, and can be repeated. In a folder of plugins, each plugin's folder is named after its id (as installs name them); hidden folders (starting with `.`) are skipped. A plugin that fails to load is reported on standard error and left out; what plugins print also goes to standard error.

### Writing a plugin

[`examples/plugins/quick_rooms`](../examples/plugins/quick_rooms) is a complete example. `plugin.toml`:

```toml
id = "quick_rooms"          # lowercase letters, digits and single underscores, up to 32
name = "Quick rooms"
version = "0.1.0"
api = 1                     # the plugin API it is written for
description = "Rectangular rooms in one step, and wall totals by type."
authors = ["…"]
license = "GPL-3.0-or-later"
homepage = "https://…"
main = "main.lua"           # the default
permissions = []            # or ["files"], see below
```

`main.lua` runs once when the plugin loads and registers commands with `ccad.command`:

```lua
local rect = require("lib.rect")   -- lib/rect.lua in the plugin's folder

ccad.command {
  name = "rectangle_room",         -- the command is quick_rooms__rectangle_room
  title = "Rectangular room",
  description = "Four walls around a rectangle, its floor and its room.",
  kind = "edit",                   -- "query", "edit" (the default) or "file"
  params = {                       -- a JSON Schema of the arguments
    properties = { width = { type = "number" }, depth = { type = "number" } },
    required = { "width", "depth" },
  },
  run = function(args)
    local p = rect.corners(0, 0, args.width, args.depth)
    for i = 1, 4 do ccad.run("wall_create", { start = p[i], ["end"] = p[i % 4 + 1] }) end
    return { room = ccad.run("room_create", { point = { args.width / 2, args.depth / 2 } }).id }
  end,
}
```

- `run` gets the arguments as a table and returns the command's result (a table, a value or nothing). Missing `required` arguments are refused before it runs; `error("message", 0)` fails the command with that message.
- **One undo step:** however many commands a plugin command runs, it is undone at once, and when it fails (an error, a failed `ccad.run`, a limit reached) everything it did is undone.
- **What a command may run:** a `query` command only queries; an `edit` command queries and edits; commands that read or write files (import, export, save) need the `files` permission (without it, edit commands that read a file a parameter names, such as `cad_import` or `fill_pattern_import` with a `path`, refuse the path; their inline forms, such as `fill_pattern_import` with `text`, still work), and a command of kind `file` can only be declared with it. Opening or creating a project, `undo`, `redo` and `language_set` cannot run inside a plugin command, nor can another plugin's command.
- **The sandbox** is that of [Lua scripts](#lua-scripts), with the budget counted per command; each plugin has its own Lua state, which keeps its variables between commands. `require("a.b")` loads `a/b.lua` from the plugin's folder (once; files outside the folder are refused), and `ccad.plugin` holds its `id`, `name` and `version`. `ccad.run` works only while a command runs, not while the plugin loads.
- **Permissions** are granted by whoever loads the plugin: `ccad --plugins` grants what the manifest asks for, since you named the folder.

Plugins are shared through the community index, [constructcraft-plugins](https://github.com/francisreboucas/constructcraft-plugins): one entry per plugin, with where to download each version and its checksum, submitted by pull request. In the app, *Manage → Plugins* installs, updates, turns off and removes plugins ([Plugins](interface.md#plugins)); without it, `ccad plugins install <file.zip> <folder>` installs a downloaded archive (checked the same way: safe paths, sizes, and a plugin that loads) and `ccad plugins remove <id> <folder>` removes one.


## Scripted components

A component piece can be a **script**: Lua source that declares the component's parameters and hotspots and builds its pieces from their values. The script is pure: it sees the values and nothing else (no commands, files or model), so it runs once for each set of values; moving or rotating a placed component does not run it again. [`examples/components/cabinet.lua`](../examples/components/cabinet.lua) is a complete example.

```lua
param.length   { "depth", label = "Depth", default = 0.55 }          -- shared by every element of a type
param.choice   { "handle", { { "bar", "Bar" }, { "none", "None" } } }
param.length   { "width", label = "Width", default = 0.8, instance = true }  -- each element's own
param.boolean  { "worktop", default = true, instance = true }
param.material { "body", label = "Body", instance = true }
hotspot        { "plinth", 0, 0.05, 0, label = "Plinth", shape = "diamond", color = "#ff8800" }

function geometry(p)
  local pieces = { box { 0, 0, 0, p.width, p.depth, 0.85, material = p.body } }
  if p.worktop then pieces[#pieces + 1] = box { 0, 0, 0.85, p.width, p.depth + 0.02, 0.03 } end
  return pieces
end
```

| Declaration | Value in `p` |
|---|---|
| `param.length`, `param.angle`, `param.number { id, label=, default=0, instance= }` | a number (meters, degrees) |
| `param.boolean { id, default=false }` | `true` or `false` |
| `param.text { id, default="" }` | a string |
| `param.choice { id, { {key, label}, … }, default=first key }` | the chosen key |
| `param.material { id, default="" }` | a project material's name (empty: the piece's material) |
| `hotspot { id, x, y, z, label=, shape="circle", color="#00ffff" }` | `{ x, y, z }`, where the element has it |

Declarations go at the script's top level, never inside `geometry`. Ids are names (letters, digits, `_`) and must be distinct; changing a label does not rename a parameter. A parameter without `instance = true` belongs to the type, and changing it changes every element of the type; with it, each element keeps its own value. Hotspot shapes are `circle`, `square`, `triangle`, `diamond` and `triangle_down`; colors are `#RRGGBB` or `#RRGGBBAA`. `p` also holds the component's other parameters, its reference planes and, in doors and windows, `WallThickness`.

`geometry(p)` returns a list of pieces (lists of pieces are flattened), in the component's frame (meters from the insertion point, x to the right, y to the back, z up). Every builder takes its values in order or by name, plus `name`, `material`, `void`, `in_plan`, `plan_only` and `detail` (a list of `coarse`, `medium`, `fine`):

| Builder | Values |
|---|---|
| `box` | `x, y, z, width, depth, height` |
| `cylinder` | `x, y, z, radius, height` |
| `extrusion` | `points` (`{x, y}` in plan), `z, height` |
| `profile` | `points` (`{u, v}` or `{u, v, radius = r}` for an arc to the next point), `offset, depth`, `plane = "plan"`, `"front"` or `"side"` |
| `revolution` | `points, offset, axis, angle` (default 360), `plane` |
| `sweep` | `path, profile, offset`, `plane` |
| `blend` | `bottom, top, offset, depth`, `plane` |
| `mesh` | `vertices` (`{x, y, z}`), `faces` (lists of vertex numbers from 1, counter-clockwise seen from outside) |

Scripts run in the [sandbox](#lua-scripts) with smaller limits (20 million instructions, 5 seconds, 64 MB, 10,000 pieces, a million points), and `math.random` repeats the same numbers. When a script fails, the element keeps the last pieces that worked and the error, with its line, shows in `element_get` (`derived.script_errors`), in the properties palette and in `component_params_get`; fixing the script or the value brings it back.

Commands:

```sh
ccad run component_create name=Cabinet 'def={"items": [{"name": "Script", "shape": {"Script": {"source": ""}}}]}'
ccad run component_script_set type=Cabinet piece=Script source=@examples/components/cabinet.lua
ccad run component_params_get type=Cabinet
ccad run component_params_set type=Cabinet name=handle value='"none"'
ccad run component_params_set 'elements=[100, 101]' name=width value=1.2
ccad run component_hotspot_move element=100 name=plinth 'point=[0, 0.08, 0]'
```

- `component_script_set` writes a script piece (or adds one). A script that does not load (a syntax error, a bad declaration) is refused; the declarations become the component's parameters and hotspots, those still declared keep their values when their kind still fits, and the result lists the errors of the first run. A component holds one script piece; its parameters are changed in the script, not with `component_param_set` or `component_param_delete`.
- `component_params_get` shows a type's parameters and hotspots, or those of placed components of one component, with `mixed` where they differ.
- `component_params_set` sets a type's value, or the instance value of several elements at once: numbers, `true`/`false`, texts, a choice's key or a material's name. It is one undo step, and nothing changes when any element refuses the value.
- `component_hotspot_move` moves a hotspot in the component's frame, or in project coordinates with `world=true`.

A material a parameter names counts as used: it cannot be deleted, and renaming it renames the values. IFC export writes the pieces the script made, as for any component.

## Macros in the app

*Manage → Macros → Record Macro* records the changes you make until you press *Stop Recording*; the macro is saved as a script (`.ccmacro`, the format above). *Run Macro* plays a macro or any script on the open project; `ccad script` runs the same files. With a macros folder set in *Preferences → File locations*, the macro file dialogs start there and *Run Macro* is a menu of its `.ccmacro` files (plus *Browse…* for any other file).

- Only edits are recorded: opening, saving and exporting are left out, so replaying never overwrites files.
- A value dragged in the properties is recorded once, with its final value; changes made in a dialog that you cancel are not recorded.
- Elements, types, views and levels created while recording are written as [references](#scripts) to the step that created them (`{"$step": n}`), so the macro uses what it creates each time it runs. The level of the plan you record in is written as `{"$level": "active"}`: the macro plays on the level of the plan active when you run it (other levels stay as recorded).
- Other steps refer to elements by id. Played on the project it was recorded on (or on a copy of it as it was when recording started) a macro reproduces the same changes; on another project, steps that name existing elements by id may fail or reach other elements.

## Command palette in the app

**Ctrl+Shift+P** (or the magnifier at the end of the ribbon tabs) opens the command palette. It finds interface commands, views to open or create and the engine's commands by name, description or shortcut, without regard to accents or case. Engine commands open a form with their JSON arguments, prefilled with the required fields; **Run** (Ctrl+Enter) executes them in the open project, as one undo step, and shows the result. File commands (`project_open`, `ifc_export`…) are left to the *File* tab.

Every ribbon button's tooltip names the engine command it runs, so what you do by hand can be written as a script.

## MCP server

`ccad mcp` is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server on standard input/output. Every command is a tool with the same name, description and input schema; queries are marked read-only. The server keeps one session, so an agent opens or creates a project, works on it over many calls and saves it.

**Claude Code:**

```sh
claude mcp add constructcad -- ccad mcp
# or with a project open from the start
claude mcp add constructcad -- ccad mcp -p /path/to/house.ccad
```

**Claude Desktop and other clients** (`claude_desktop_config.json` or the client's MCP settings; use the full path of `ccad`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "constructcad": { "command": "/path/to/ccad", "args": ["mcp", "--lang", "en"] }
  }
}
```

On Windows, `ccad.exe` is installed next to the app, by default in `C:\Program Files\ConstructCraft` (JSON doubles the backslashes):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "constructcad": { "command": "C:\\Program Files\\ConstructCraft\\ccad.exe", "args": ["mcp"] }
  }
}
```

The installer's *Add ccad to the PATH* option (on by default) lets clients find plain `ccad`, but only clients started after the installation see the new PATH; the full path always works. Pointed at the app itself (`constructcraft mcp` or `constructcraft --mcp`), the client gets the same server: the app runs the `ccad` next to it on the same standard input and output.

Requests an agent can handle with these tools, for example: *"open house.ccad, list the doors without a mark and number them"*, *"import model.ifc and tell me the volume of the concrete walls"*, *"add a second floor 3 m above the ground floor with the same exterior walls"*, *"export sheet A101 as PDF"*.

Notes:

- Paths are on the machine where `ccad` runs.
- Errors come back as tool results with `isError` and the error object, so the model can correct its call.
- The server speaks protocol revisions 2025-06-18, 2025-03-26 and 2024-11-05 and is implemented in `crates/cc_cli/src/mcp.rs` (JSON-RPC 2.0, one message per line).

## For developers: adding a command

Every user-facing feature starts as an engine command; the app calls it rather than editing the document itself.

1. Write the parameter struct in `crates/cc_engine/src/commands/<area>.rs`: `#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize, JsonSchema)]`, `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]`, a doc comment (the command's description) and a doc comment on every field (its parameter description; a test fails without them).
2. Implement `Command` with `NAME` (`snake_case`), `KIND` and `run`. Resolve references with `refs`, change the model inside `commands::edit` (one undo step, refused if the result needs repair), and return JSON (`created(s, id)` for elements). Use `t!` messages for errors people will read.
3. Register it in its group in `registry.rs`.
4. Test it in `crates/cc_engine/tests/commands.rs` through `Session::execute`.
5. Regenerate the reference: `cargo run -p cc_cli -- reference > docs/commands.md` (a test fails while it is stale).
6. In the app, call it with `Session::run(Command { … })`, `actions::run_command` or the `engine_edit` helpers (use `Session::run_merged` for dragged values). That also makes it recordable in macros.

Commands added at run time implement `cc_engine::Extension` (`crates/cc_engine/src/extension.rs`) and are set on the session with `Session::set_extension`; `cc_plugins::PluginHost` is the one for Lua plugins. `Session::commands`, `describe` and `kind_of` cover both, and `Session::execute` runs an extension command as one undo step (`Document::squash_since`).

Architecture details are in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).
